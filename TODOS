Things to look at for competition:
    - When lights are working add the light ports in
    - Also have the shooter flags reset when the driver moves but need lights on or else driver wont know we are firing
    - Maybe have shooter drop automatically after shooting
    - Try the new quickshot mode in the new version of the visionlineup(increases the error)
    - If we are not y cabling the talons then use talon set class, and put real values in there
